Android game based on `agar.io`. The premise is that you run away from bigger players and consume smaller ones along with everything on your way.

There are few custom skins featuring the republicans and democrats from 2016 USA election.

## Here's how it looks

## Apk

If you wish to play it on your phone here is downloadable [apk file](./android-client/release/app-release.apk)

I haven't deployed the application to google store since they charge 25\$ for creating an account.

## Techonlogies

I have used good old java to create android client and spring-boot on the backend to setup some sockets.
